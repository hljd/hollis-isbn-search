# HOLLIS Book Search

A Python and Streamlit application developed for Harvard Library’s Judaica Division to help staff check spreadsheet book lists against the HOLLIS Library Catalog and identify potential purchase candidates.

> **Development status:** This project is under active development. Current testing uses the **Sandbox environment** through Harvard APIgee. Features, documentation, and search behavior will continue to be updated as staff test the app and provide feedback. The interface also offers Production, but the current testing workflow uses Sandbox.

## Original Development
The application was originally designed and developed by Chloe Qiu (HSPH '27). The project is maintained by the Judaica Division of Harvard Library.

## What the app does

- Accepts Excel and delimited text files.
- Lets users choose a worksheet, a header row within the first five rows, and separate ISBN and original-title columns.
- Normalizes and validates ISBNs, then searches HOLLIS through Harvard APIgee’s Primo API.
- Confirms ISBN matches and checks for the displayed HOLLIS number.
- Adds a **Notes** column in column A and colors rows for purchase screening or review.
- Shows progress, elapsed search time, an estimated remaining time, and a results preview.
- Downloads a processed Excel workbook while retaining as much of the original workbook as practical.

**Searches are ISBN-only.** The original-title selector is required by the interface, but titles are not currently searched or compared. Title-based searching is planned for a later version.

## Result colors and Notes

| Row color | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green | No confirmed ISBN match after a successful search with sufficient candidate metadata; a potential purchase candidate. | Blank. |
| Red | Exactly one confirmed ISBN match with a nonempty displayed HOLLIS number, with no unresolved candidates. | Matching title, linked to HOLLIS when a link can be constructed. |
| Yellow | Multiple confirmed matches, or a single confirmed match without a displayed HOLLIS number. | Matching title(s); records without a HOLLIS number receive a manual-review note. |
| Uncolored | Missing or invalid ISBN, search failure, insufficient metadata, or a row not searched because the run stopped. | Explanation of the issue and any available partial matches. |

The displayed HOLLIS number is read from **`pnx.display.lds01`**. This mapping was checked against three Sandbox API responses and their HOLLIS export on September 24, 2026. Generic identifiers such as `mms`, `control.recordid`, or an Alma ID in a URL are not used as substitutes.

This is a **screening rule**, not independent proof of physical holdings or permanent ebook ownership. Yellow and uncolored rows require review. “No HOLLIS number” does not itself prove that Harvard does not own a book.

A single yellow match without a HOLLIS number is formatted as:

```text
No HOLLIS number; manual review required: Matching title
```

The whole Notes cell links to the record when a URL is available. For multiple matches, each title and available URL appears on a separate line; the review prefix is added only to records missing a HOLLIS number. Multiple destinations are written as text because this implementation uses one Excel cell hyperlink per cell. The on-screen preview displays the Notes text; the inserted hyperlink is in the downloaded workbook.

The summary label **Search errors** includes all uncolored rows, including missing and invalid ISBNs. Uncolored means the app does not apply a new fill; any original fill remains.

## Project files

Keep these files together, using the exact names below. Remove download suffixes such as `(1)` or `(2)` from Python filenames.

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app.py` | Streamlit interface, selectors, progress, timing display, results, and download. |
| `hollis_api.py` | API requests, response parsing, ISBN matching, HOLLIS-number extraction, links, and retries. |
| `isbn_utils.py` | ISBN normalization, checksum validation, and ISBN-10/ISBN-13 comparison. |
| `spreadsheet_processor.py` | File import, duplicate handling, recovery pass, Notes, and workbook export. |
| `time_estimator.py` | Per-run timing samples, pending searches, and scheduled-wait estimates. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies. |
| `README.md` | Setup and usage documentation. |

## Run locally

The source uses Python 3.10+ syntax. Use a Python version compatible with the installed dependencies and, when deploying, the selected hosting runtime.

From the project folder, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on macOS or Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The current dependency ranges are:

```text
streamlit>=1.40,<2
requests>=2.32,<3
openpyxl>=3.1,<4
```

Create a `.streamlit` folder in the project directory, then create `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with:

```toml
HOLLIS_API_KEY = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace the placeholder locally. The app reads the key from Streamlit secrets and sends it in the **`X-Api-Key`** request header. The API secret is not used. The key must support the environment selected in the app; selecting an environment does not automatically select a different key.

Add these entries to your repository’s `.gitignore` before committing:

```gitignore
.streamlit/secrets.toml
.env
.venv/
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.DS_Store
```

An optional `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` may be committed with placeholder values only. Never commit the real secrets file or paste credentials into logs, screenshots, or issue reports. A `.gitignore` entry does not remove a secret already committed to Git history or prevent a manual upload through the GitHub website.

Start the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If the command is not found, use `python -m streamlit run app.py` in the activated environment.

## Using the app

1. Upload a supported file.
2. For text files, check the preview and adjust **Text file options** if the characters or columns look incorrect.
3. Select the worksheet and its header row. The default is row 1; available choices are within rows 1–5.
4. Select the ISBN column and a different original-title column. Check these selections carefully.
5. Select **Sandbox** for the current testing workflow.
6. Click **Search HOLLIS** and follow the progress and timing messages.
7. Review the summary and Notes, then download the checked workbook.

Only nonempty rows below the selected header are processed. The first-five-rows preview shows columns A–L; all eligible columns remain available in the selectors. Changing the file or search settings clears the previous downloadable result. Completed results and elapsed time are retained in the current Streamlit session across ordinary reruns, but are not a permanent run history.

### Supported input formats

- `.xlsx` workbooks.
- `.csv`, `.tsv`, and delimited `.txt` files.
- Comma, tab, semicolon, and pipe separators, with automatic detection or manual selection.

Text encoding options include UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, Windows-1252, Latin-1, Windows-1255, Windows-1251, Shift JIS, GB18030, and Mac Roman. Automatic mode recognizes UTF-16/UTF-32 byte-order marks, otherwise tries UTF-8 and falls back to Windows-1252 with a warning. It is not a universal encoding detector: use an explicit setting if text looks wrong. UTF-16 without a byte-order mark requires the appropriate LE or BE option.

Trailing null padding is removed with a warning. Unsupported embedded control characters are rejected. Text imports create a worksheet named `Books` and preserve fields as text, including leading zeros and values beginning with `=`.

Legacy `.xls`, macro-enabled `.xlsm`, and `.ods` files are not supported. Convert them to `.xlsx` or a supported text format first.

### ISBN preparation

Use one ISBN per cell, preferably stored as text. The app removes whitespace and hyphens, handles integer-valued numbers and digit strings ending in `.0`, and accepts a final `X` in ISBN-10 values. It validates length, character format, and ISBN-10/ISBN-13 checksums.

Blank cells, malformed values, and cells containing multiple identifiers remain uncolored. The app cannot restore leading zeros already lost by Excel. ISBN formulas are not evaluated; use their calculated values as input.

## Search and API behavior

Requests use `q=any,contains,<ISBN>` with `vid=01HVD_INST:HVD2`, `tab=LibraryCatalog`, and `scope=MyInstitution`. Returned candidates are compared against **`pnx.addata.isbn`**, allowing equivalent ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 values. Titles come from **`pnx.display.title`**, and records are deduplicated using their returned `@id`.

The client retrieves pages of up to 50 candidates and stops for manual review when a query exceeds its configured 500-result limit or a response is incomplete or inconsistent. If candidate metadata cannot establish the result reliably, the app does not classify the row green. Two or more confirmed matches already qualify for yellow review.

Identical normalized ISBN strings share a result within each run. ISBN-10/ISBN-13 equivalence is used for matching, but equivalent inputs of different lengths may still generate separate searches. No shared cross-user result cache is implemented.

| Setting | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Request pacing | Sequential requests, with a normal 2-second gap after a response. |
| Timeouts | 5-second connection timeout and 30-second read timeout. |
| Temporary failures | Retries HTTP 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, timeouts, and connection failures. |
| Attempts | Up to four attempts per page per pass. |
| Retry delays | 5, 15, and 30 seconds, plus jitter; honors a longer valid `Retry-After`. |
| Long server wait | A `Retry-After` over 120 seconds stops the run rather than retrying early. |
| Recovery | One recovery pass for transient failures and any searches deferred by a stopped first pass, after a wait of at least 30 seconds. |
| Persistent rate limit | Exhausted HTTP 429 retries stop the first pass; a persistent 429 during recovery ends the run. |
| Authentication failure | HTTP 401 or 403 stops the run without recovery. |

These are application defaults, not documented Harvard API quota limits. Pacing applies per client/run, so simultaneous users can collectively exceed a shared API key’s limit.

## Elapsed time and estimated remaining time

The elapsed timer includes requests, scheduled pauses, and recovery searches. It excludes workbook export. The final duration appears with the results.

The remaining-time estimate begins after five completed query attempts have supplied timing samples. Normalized duplicates and invalid rows do not add searches; a query repeated in recovery contributes another timing sample. The estimate uses average observed query duration and pending work, including known scheduled retry/recovery waits. Completed retry delays remain in the historical average for that run.

Scheduled wait countdowns refresh roughly once per second. During a blocking HTTP request, the display may not update until the request returns or times out. Estimates can rise after new delays and may overestimate when historical retry costs are combined with a known wait. Small batches can finish before an estimate appears. No historical timing database is required or maintained.

Row progress measures rows with a result, including provisional failures. It can reach 100% before recovery finishes; wait for the completed results and download button.

## Excel output and preservation limits

Output is always an `.xlsx` file named `Searched_<original_filename>.xlsx`.

The app inserts **Notes** in column A of the selected worksheet, with its header on the chosen header row. Original columns shift right. Original worksheets, cell values, formula text, fonts, row heights, and basic styles are retained where supported by openpyxl. Existing column widths and merged-cell ranges are explicitly shifted with the inserted column.

Processed rows receive light green, red, or yellow fills. Borders are applied to the header and processed rows across the original worksheet column span plus Notes. Other worksheets are retained and are not searched in that run. Text files become new workbooks, so they have no original Excel formatting to preserve.

Column insertion does **not** repair formula references, table ranges, named ranges, filters, or freeze-pane positions. Complex workbook features may not survive an openpyxl round trip unchanged. Ordinary tabular book lists work best; inspect output from complex workbooks. Notes beyond Excel’s 32,767-character cell limit are shortened in the workbook, with the full text retained in the preview.

## Deploy through GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Commit the five Python modules, `requirements.txt`, this README, and `.gitignore` to the deployed repository branch. Exclude the real secrets file.
2. Connect the repository to Streamlit Community Cloud and select `app.py` as the entry point.
3. Add `HOLLIS_API_KEY = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY"` to the app’s private **Secrets** settings, replacing the placeholder there.
4. Deploy with a compatible Python version, then test a small book list in Sandbox.
5. Configure the app’s sharing settings for the intended staff testers and share its URL.

The key stays out of GitHub and the app interface, but is stored on the hosting server so the app can access HOLLIS. Staff upload their spreadsheets to that server for processing. The application builds output in memory and keeps completed output in session state; it does not implement a permanent upload archive.

Deploy related modules together. Mixing old and new files can produce errors such as a missing `hollis_number` attribute or an unexpected callback argument. After an update, start a fresh search; reboot the hosted app if it is still running an older version.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Missing API key | Local file must be `.streamlit/secrets.toml`, with `HOLLIS_API_KEY` at the top level; hosted deployments need the same key in Secrets settings. |
| All ISBNs appear invalid | Confirm the ISBN and title selectors were not swapped, choose the correct header, and check for lost leading zeros or multiple values per cell. |
| Garbled text or incorrect columns | Set the text encoding and separator explicitly. |
| Frequent HTTP 429 messages | Allow scheduled waits and recovery; avoid simultaneous large runs using the same key. |
| Missing module or attribute after deployment | Check exact filenames and upload all related modules from the same version. |
| Workbook cannot be exported | Retain the original file, review available results, and check the server logs; unusual workbook structures or mismatched scripts may be involved. |
| Timer appears stationary | Scheduled waits update regularly, but an in-flight HTTP request can temporarily block display updates. |

Logging defaults to `WARNING`. To enable request/status diagnostics locally:

```bash
HOLLIS_LOG_LEVEL=INFO streamlit run app.py
```

Application logging can include normalized ISBNs, HTTP statuses, retry waits, and match counts. The application’s logging statements do not include the API key or API secret. Return to `WARNING` or `ERROR` to reduce log output.

## Feedback and ongoing development

This app will continue to be updated based on Sandbox testing and staff feedback. When reporting an issue, include the selected environment, input format, header/column selections, expected behavior, and the error message or a small non-sensitive example. Do not include API credentials. Further work includes title-based searching and validation of the workflow against the Production environment.
